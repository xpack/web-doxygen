## Introduction

<p>Doxygen is the de facto standard tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources, but it also supports other popular programming languages such as C, Objective-C, C#, PHP, Java, Python, IDL (Corba, Microsoft, and UNO/OpenOffice flavors), Fortran, and to some extent D. Doxygen also supports the hardware description language VHDL.</p>


<p>Doxygen can help you in three ways:</p>


<ol class="doxyList" type="1">
<li>It can generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and/or an off-line reference manual (in <code>{\LaTeX}</code>) from a set of documented source files. There is also support for generating output in RTF (MS-Word), PostScript, hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML, and Unix man pages. The documentation is extracted directly from the sources, which makes it much easier to keep the documentation consistent with the source code.</li>
<li>You can <a href="/web-doxygen/docs/pages/starting/#extract_all">configure</a> Doxygen to extract the code structure from undocumented source files. This is very useful to quickly find your way in large source distributions. Doxygen can also visualize the relations between the various elements by means of include dependency graphs, inheritance diagrams, and collaboration diagrams, which are all generated automatically.</li>
<li>You can also use Doxygen for creating normal documentation (as I did for the Doxygen user manual and web-site).</li>
</ol>

<p>Doxygen is developed under macOS and Linux, but is set-up to be highly portable. As a result, it runs on most other Unix flavors as well. Furthermore, executables for Windows are available.</p>


<p><br/>
This manual is divided into three parts, each of which is divided into several sections.</p>


<p>The first part forms a user manual:</p>

## User examples

<p>Doxygen supports a number of <a href="/web-doxygen/docs/pages/output">output formats</a> where HTML is the most popular one. I've gathered <a href="https://www.doxygen.org/results.html">some nice examples</a> of real-life projects using Doxygen.</p>


<p>These are part of a larger <a href="https://www.doxygen.org/projects.html">list of projects</a> that use Doxygen. If you know other projects, let <a href="mailto:doxygen@gmail.com?subject=New%20project%20using%20Doxygen">me</a> know and I'll add them.</p>


## Future work

<p>Although Doxygen is successfully used by large number of companies and open source projects already, there is always room for improvement.</p>


<p>You can also submit enhancement requests in <a href="https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen/issues">the bug tracker</a>.</p>
